## 🙌 Acknowledgements

This project was initially inspired by and built alongside the following tutorial:
- Uhiene – *Build a Responsive Website with Vue.js & Tailwind CSS*

While following the tutorial, I implemented additional improvements including:
- Applied component refactoring techniques for reusability (e.g., ButtonComponent, CarCard)
- Applied common front-end structuring patterns by separating assets, data, and UI components
- Enhanced responsive design across breakpoints
- Independently deployed the application using AWS S3 and CloudFront for global content delivery
